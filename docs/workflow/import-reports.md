# Import Reports

Falcoria allows importing scan results directly into the system.  
This is useful when you want to reuse data from external tools or work in offline projects.

---

## How It Works

- Reports can be imported using different [Import Modes](../concepts/import-modes/index.md).  
- Importing does not require the built-in scanner — you can load results manually.  
- This makes it possible to use Falcoria as a **shared storage and single source of truth** for the team.  

---

## When To Use

- **Partial scans:** if you scan part of the scope separately and want to merge the results.  
- **Offline projects:** when you don’t run scans through Falcoria but need a central database for results.  
- **External tools:** when results are produced outside and should be consolidated in one place.
