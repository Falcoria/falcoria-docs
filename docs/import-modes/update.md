# `update` Mode

The `update` mode allows you to **enrich or refine** existing scan data without overwriting the entire IP record.  
It performs a **smart field-level merge** â€” updating only the values that are explicitly present in the new report.

This is perfect for progressive scanning, banner grabbing, or incrementally improving service detection.

## âœ… When to Use `update`

Use this mode when:

- You're enriching data with additional scan phases (e.g. version detection)
- You're merging passive and active results for the same IPs
- You're updating banners, services, or OS details from more specialized tools
- You want to preserve existing port data while refining metadata

---

## ðŸ§  Behavior Summary

- If an IP does **not** exist in the project â†’ it will be added
- If an IP **exists** â†’ its ports stay intact; only fields explicitly present in the import are updated
- Fields that are missing in the import report will not erase or overwrite existing data

---

## ðŸ§  Smart Merge Logic

Unlike `replace`, which wipes everything, `update` is non-destructive and selective.  
Itâ€™s ideal for long-term scan enrichment, especially when combining different tools or scan passes.

---

## ðŸ’¡ Example

```bash
python3 falcli.py project ips import --file report_update1.xml --mode update
```

Output:

```text
Imported IPs report into project 'example-project-id'. Result: 1 IP.
```

Existing port data will remain, but service names or banners may be updated.
