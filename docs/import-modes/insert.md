# `insert` Mode

The `insert` mode is the safest way to import scan results into a Falcoria project.  
It **adds new IPs** and their data only if they do not already exist â€” and **skips duplicates silently**.

This makes it ideal for importing results from passive scans, segmented scopes, or slow asset discovery â€” where you donâ€™t want to accidentally overwrite or duplicate anything already collected.

## âœ… When to Use `insert`

Use this mode when:

- You're importing scan data from multiple small or partial scans
- You want to avoid modifying any existing project data
- Youâ€™re loading results from distributed scanning agents or external sources
- Youâ€™re transferring scans from an isolated or offline network environment where direct integration isnâ€™t possible

## ðŸ§  Behavior Summary

- If an IP does **not** exist in the project â†’ it will be added
- If an IP **already exists** â†’ it will be skipped without error
- Ports are only added for new IPs; existing IPs and their ports remain untouched

---

## ðŸ’¡ Example

```bash
python3 falcli.py project ips import --file report_insert1.xml --mode insert
```

Output:

```text
Imported IPs report into project 'example-project-id'. Result: 2 IPs.
```

If you run it again with the same file, it will detect duplicates and skip them:

```text
No new IPs added in project 
```
