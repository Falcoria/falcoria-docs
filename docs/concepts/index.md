This section explains the key mechanisms that define how Falcoria works.  
They are not optional features, but the foundation that makes it different from traditional scanning tools.

## What Concepts Cover

- [**Deduplication**](deduplication.md): Prevents duplicate scans and tasks, saving time and resources.  
- [**Distribution**](distribution.md): Enables fast, parallel scanning by splitting work across multiple workers.  
- [**History Tracking**](track-history.md): Records changes between scans, so teams can focus on what matters.  
- [**Import Modes**](import-modes/index.md): Controls how new data is merged, updated, or replaced in the system.  

Together, these concepts address the main challenges of large and changing scopes.
