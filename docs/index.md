# What is Falcoria

**Falcoria** is a distributed scanning and coordination platform built for penetration testers and red teams. It automates host discovery, port scanning, and result consolidation across multiple systems — enabling structured, repeatable reconnaissance workflows at scale.

---

## Why Falcoria

Traditional recon workflows rely on scattered tools, manual scripting, and inconsistent outputs. Falcoria centralizes scanning, state tracking, and result management into a single, queryable system — eliminating data duplication and untracked effort.

## Who It's For

Falcoria is built for:
- Penetration testers managing complex scopes
- Red teams running distributed recon
- Security engineers automating scan workflows across environments

## What Falcoria Provides

**Speeds up infrastructure scans by splitting tasks across distributed workers.**  
Scans complete in minutes or hours — not days — with no false positives or missing data.

**Automates scan data management —** merging reports, removing duplicates, and keeping results centrally organized and searchable.  
No more manual cleanup, scattered files, or repeat scans just to find what you’ve already discovered.

**Delivers real-time access to scan results for every team member —** with native support for JSON, XML, and API integrations.  
No waiting for reports, no manual exports, no compatibility issues between tools or teammates.

**Scales with your needs —** start with a one-liner, or dive deep using config files and CLI options.  
Share scan presets across teams for consistency, or fine-tune settings per project for precise control.
