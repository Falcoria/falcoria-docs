# What is Falcoria

**Falcoria** is a distributed scanning and coordination platform built for penetration testers and red teams. It automates host discovery, port scanning, and result consolidation across multiple systems — giving you real-time visibility into your perimeter and removing the need for fragmented tools or outdated results.

**Automates scan data management —** merging reports, removing duplicates, and keeping results centrally organized and searchable. No more manual cleanup, scattered files, or repeat scans just to find what you’ve already discovered.  
[Learn how deduplication works ›](use-cases/deduplication-behavior.md)

**Delivers real-time access to scan results for every team member —** with native support for JSON, XML, and API integrations. No waiting for reports, no manual exports, no compatibility issues between tools or teammates.
